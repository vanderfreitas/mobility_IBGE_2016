# Robustness analysis in an inter-cities mobility network: modeling municipal, state and federal initiatives as failures and attacks toward SARS-CoV-2 containment


Dependencies (tested on Python 3.6.10 :: Anaconda, Inc.):
* matplotlib
* igraph
* numpy


To generate the three networks from the raw data and run all the simulations for each network:
- Set the network in the file: *simulations_input.txt* and run
```
bash run_everything.sh
```
